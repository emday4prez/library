<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This project was created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum for the Full Stack JavaScript Developer path. When adding a book, a modal holding a form is created and added to the document. After the form has been submitted the modal is removed from the DOM and a new HTML table row is created for the new book.


### Built With

* Vanilla JS
* CSS
* HTML


I created this project to practice and help build foundational vanilla JavaScript knowledge. I improved my understanding by programmatically creating and removing DOM elements with JavaScript.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Disadvantage

Although this was fun to practice. Creating DOM elements this way makes it difficult avoid repeating code. As a result, there is a lot of repeated JavaScript for creating and modifying HTML elements.
